    "- The traditional choice was between **active and passive**.\n",
    "  - Passive: Don't try and outperform the index\n",
    "- New: Factor investing lies in-between. Build a systematic set of rules to try and outperform the S&P. \n",
    "  - Call it \"Low cost active\". It's not just the S&P500, *but* it's passive in the sense that there are no human, subjective decisions in there (after constructing the rules)\n",
    "- Indicization refers to the trend of creating new indices that capture the portion of active management that is rules based and systematic, and in the long run should outperform the cap-weighted benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "A factor investor looks at active funds and tries to figure out what are the **drivers** that provide that excess return (e.g. small size, or political risk). Then he figures out how to get them for himself, inexpensively.\n",
