# Data Structures and Algorithms

- Coursera's Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
  - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?
- There's a companion book out:
  - http://learningalgorithms.tilda.ws
  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/0985731214
- Also nice, recommended as a prerequisite, is this course:

### Notes

- Often, to find the key algorithm, you need to know something interesting about
  the problem. Example: Knowing about the key lemmma for Euclidean Algorithm to
  efficiently compute the Greatest Common Divisor (in Week 1).
