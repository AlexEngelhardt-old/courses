- You can't teach a generic procedure for designing goog algorithms.
- But: You can
  - practice designing algorithms
  - learn common algorithmic design techniques. We'll look at:
    - Greedy algorithms
    - Divide and Conquer
    - Dynamic Programming


- Levels of Design
  - **Naive Algorithm**: Often just typing out the definition of the
    algorithm. Slow.
  - **Algorithm with standard tools**: E.g. by using a greedy algorithm
  - **Optimized algorithm**: Improve the existing algo. E.g. by rearranging
    steps or by introducing a specific **data structure**
  - **Magic algorithm**: But sometimes you need some unique insight, a clever
    new idea, sometimes no one else had that before you.
